# Impure Syntax

This is a variant of the [Pure Syntax](https://atom.io/packages/pure-syntax) project. The primary difference is that this theme uses a darking (less purple) background.

> Above example using this syntax theme with the [dash ui theme](https://atom.io/themes/dash-ui).

# Install

From the command line:

`apm install impure-syntax`

If the command line isn't your thing:

- Go to **Settings > Install**
- Search for `impure-syntax` and click **Install**
- Go to **Settings > Themes** and choose **Pure** from the dropdown menu
- Happy coding! :heart:
