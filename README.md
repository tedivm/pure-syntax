# Impure Syntax

![Example](https://i.imgur.com/BCr0VWE.png)

This is a variant of the [Pure Syntax](https://atom.io/packages/pure-syntax) project. The primary difference is that this theme uses a darking (less purple) background.

# Install

From the command line:

`apm install impure-syntax`

If the command line isn't your thing:

- Go to **Settings > Install**
- Search for `impure-syntax` and click **Install**
- Go to **Settings > Themes** and choose **Pure** from the dropdown menu
- Happy coding! :heart:
